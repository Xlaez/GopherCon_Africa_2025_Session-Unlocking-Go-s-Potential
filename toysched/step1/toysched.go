/**
What we are achieving with this:

We'll create a package called toysched with structs for G (goroutine), P (processor), and M (machine). Each G will have a simple function to "run" (we'll simulate work). Ps will have a run queue (slice of Gs). Ms will hold a reference to a P.

What this does:
G: Holds the work (a closure) and state.
P: Owns a FIFO queue for local Gs.
M: Tracks what's it's running and its P.

In Step2, we will add the next layer: A central Scheduler to orchestrate everything. This will:

Hold slices of Ps and Ms.
Bind Ms to Ps (one-to-one for now).
Create a simple NewG helper to spawn Gs with auto-ID.
Enqueue a G to a P's run queue.
Have a basic Schedule method on M to pick and run a G from its P's queue.
We'll keep it minimalâ€”no parallelism yet (we'll simulate with loops). This lets us test one M/P pair running one G.
